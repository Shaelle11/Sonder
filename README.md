# Sonder — Short Summary

Sonder is a micro-reflection experience that uses subtle visual language and simple interactions to help users pause and check in with themselves.

Highlights
- Four time-of-day capsules (morning, afternoon, evening, night) with distinct visual tone.
- Mood-driven reflections and gentle self-care prompts.
- Built using only HTML and CSS; no accounts or tracking.
