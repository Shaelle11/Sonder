# Sonder

## Project Statement
Love is often framed as something meant for others, while self-care and self-reflection are overlooked.  
Sonder is a calm, self-love web experience designed to help users pause, check in with themselves, and engage in gentle reflection throughout the day. The project explores how thoughtful interaction and emotional awareness can be communicated using only HTML and CSS.

## Target Audience
Sonder is designed for individuals who want a simple, calming space to reflect on their emotional state, especially students, remote workers, and people navigating busy or mentally demanding routines. It is suitable for users who appreciate minimal design, gentle prompts, and emotionally supportive digital experiences.

## Core Features
- **Time-of-Day Moods:** Users can select morning, afternoon, evening, or night, each with a distinct visual theme, tone, and background.
- **Mood-Based Reflection:** The interface adapts messages, quotes, and advice based on how the user feels in that moment.
- **Self-Care Check-In:** Gentle checklist interactions encourage small acts of care without pressure or tracking.
- **Calming Visual Design:** Soft colors, smooth transitions, and minimal layouts create a grounding and supportive atmosphere.
