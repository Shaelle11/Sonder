# Sonder — Visual Design Documentation
## 1. Visual Direction & Theme
Overall Mood

Sonder’s visual language is calm, intimate, and reflective.
The interface is designed to feel like a quiet pause rather than an active task, aligning with the theme of self-love by encouraging gentleness, warmth, and emotional safety.

The design avoids visual noise and prioritizes breathing space, soft contrasts, and slow visual rhythm.

## 2. Color Palette

### Primary Colors

These colors form the emotional foundation of the interface.

**Soft Pink**
Represents calm, introspection, softness, and emotional clarity.
Used for backgrounds, highlights, and mood accents.

**Cream**
Adds warmth, neutrality, and comfort.
Used for text backgrounds, cards, and to soften contrast.

### Secondary / Accent Colors

(Used subtly across mood states)

- Muted lilac tones for emphasis

- Warm beige tones for balance

- Deep blue tones for night moods

- Color transitions are subtle to avoid overstimulation and to maintain emotional consistency across time capsules.

## 3. Typography
**Heading Typeface**

Style: Serif or soft-rounded font
Reasoning:
Serif or rounded fonts convey warmth, emotion, and thoughtfulness, aligning with the theme of love and reflection.

Used for:

Page headings

Section titles

Key emotional prompts

**Body Typeface**

Style: Clean sans-serif
Reasoning:
Ensures readability and clarity while supporting longer reflective text without visual fatigue.

Used for:

Paragraph text

Navigation labels

Buttons and prompts

Typography Hierarchy

Large, spacious headings

Comfortable line spacing

Minimal font pairing (maximum of two fonts)

Emphasis through size and spacing rather than bold colors

## 4. Layout & Spacing

- One-screen layouts to reduce cognitive load

- Generous white space to create breathing room

- Centered or softly aligned content to feel intentional and calm

- Clear separation between sections without harsh dividers

- The layout prioritizes emotional flow over information density.

5. Imagery & Visual Elements
Imagery Style

- Soft gradients and abstract visuals

- Minimal photography, if used

- Nature-inspired textures (sky, light, shadows)

- Imagery is used to support mood, not distract from it.

- Icons & UI Elements

- Simple, line-based icons

- Rounded edges and soft corners

- No sharp or aggressive shapes

- Visual elements remain secondary to text and emotion.

6. Mood-Based Visual Treatment

Although implemented with HTML and CSS only, each time capsule has a distinct visual tone:

Morning: Light, airy, minty and yellow tones

Afternoon: Balanced soft orange tones with gentle contrast

Evening: Warm creams and soft orange undertones

Night: Deep blues and muted purples

Mood selections influence tone rather than layout, keeping the interface consistent and predictable.


7. CSS Structure
   - Base.css: For setting up design tokens for project
   - Layout.css: SetUp designs for page layouts
   - Component.css: Reusable designs for components on different pages
   - Themes.css: Different themes for various pages
   - Index.css: Home page specific designs

10. Closing Visual Intent
