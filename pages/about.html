    <!-- PAGE INTRO -->
    <section class="page-intro">
      <h1>About Sonder</h1>
      <p>
        Sonder is a self-love space designed for quiet moments,
        honest emotions, and gentle self-awareness.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- WHY SONDER -->
    <section class="about-purpose">
      <h2>Why Sonder exists</h2>
      <p>
        Love is often presented as something we give externally, to partners,
        friends, family, or the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sonder challenges that idea by turning love inward.
        It creates room for reflection, rest, motivation, and reassurance—
        without pressure to improve or perform.
      </p>

      <h2>How Sonder works</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Time Capsules:</strong>
          Experiences shaped around time, morning, afternoon, evening, and night.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Mood-Led Navigation:</strong>
          Choose how you feel—anxious, driven, tired, hopeful—and let the tone respond.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Calm Design:</strong>
          Minimal visuals and thoughtful prompts to avoid overload.

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="about-philosophy">
      <h2>Our philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Sonder is not here to fix you.
        It’s here to sit with you, wherever you are,
        and adjust to however you feel.
