   <h1>About Sonder</h1>
  <p>
     Sonder is a quiet digital space built for the moments in between
    the pauses, the uncertainty, the soft realizations that we are
    allowed to feel exactly as we are.

    <!-- WHY SONDER -->
   <section class="about-purpose">
  <h2>Why Sonder exists</h2>
  <p>
    In a world that constantly asks us to be productive, polished, and
    emotionally composed, there is little room for stillness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sonder was created to hold that space, not to improve you,
    not to optimize you, but to gently acknowledge you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Self-love does not always look like confidence.
    Sometimes it looks like resting.
    Sometimes it looks like trying.
    Sometimes it looks like simply staying.

          <strong>Time Capsules:</strong>
          Experiences shaped around time, morning, afternoon, evening, and night.

        <li>
          <strong>Mood-Led Navigation:</strong>
          Choose how you feel—anxious, driven, tired, hopeful and let the tone respond.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Calm Design:</strong>
          Minimal visuals and thoughtful prompts to avoid overload.

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="about-philosophy">
  <h2>Our philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    Sonder is not here to fix you.
    It is here to sit with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    To remind you that every version of you,
    anxious, tired, hopeful, driven,
    deserves softness.
